 registration of user algo :
    production base mindset
    1 :) get user details from frontend  (according to schema) 
    2 :) validation - not empty or any other issue from the front end part 
    3 :) Check if user already exists : usernaem , email 
    4 :) Check for images , also for avatar 
    5 :) upload them to cloudinary , avatar 
    6 :) Create user object - create entry in db
    7 :) remove password and refresh token field from response
    8 :) check for user creation 
    9 :) return response or sent error 

user login algo : 
1 :) get user data from req.body {email , password , refreshToken}
2 :) check if the user exists if yes return its refreshToken 
3 :) for the specific _id check if the refresh token matches and the password 
4 :) if matches then give the user the access of the account and give him a accessToken


req body -> data 
email & password
find the user 
check password 
access & refresh token send to the user 
send cookies
